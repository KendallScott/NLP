The dataframe of the reviews also has the url for the full review, which could later be used to pull full text. While there was an API for Rotten Tomatoes, I found that simply scraping the url was quicker with beautiful soup, so I leveraged that instead of the API (examples I found of the API calls online didn't work). It looked like IMDB no longer allowed web scraping, which was why I chose this website."
